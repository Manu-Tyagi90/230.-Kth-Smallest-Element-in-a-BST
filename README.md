# 230.-Kth-Smallest-Element-in-a-BST
Given the `root` of a binary search tree, and an integer `k`, return the `kth` smallest value (1-indexed) of all the values of the nodes in the tree.

## Example 1:

```
Input: root = [3,1,4,null,2], k = 1
Output: 1
```
## Example 2:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4a255f8b-df3a-4620-85bc-f1460db054f9)

```
Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,null,1], k = 3
Output: 3
 ```

### Constraints:

+ The number of nodes in the tree is n.
+ 1 <= k <= n <= 104
+ 0 <= Node.val <= 104
